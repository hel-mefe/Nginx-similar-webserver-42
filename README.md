# Hey wassup Youssef ?


Well, this is a small guide for how to approach this small webserv


The Webserv architecture is as follows:

- multiplexers: folder that contain all the multiplexers for the moment we work only by poll (maybe we can add some others later but for now the important thing is poll to validate the project w safii)

- parser: folder that contain a configfile parser
- server: not needed
- includes: some important global includes
- fastCGI: contain the cgis
- www: the folder where assets should be located (configured in configfile)


THE POST TASK:

For the post task there is a folder named methods here multiplexers/poll/methods/poll.class.hpp poll.methods.hpp

Please work a bro with these 2 files to complete the post method, anyway feel free to edit the program as you wish!!


Other Important Tasks I have to complete:
- Directory Listing for Get
- CGI for delete

I'll add them later on don't worry!

See yaa mate.
