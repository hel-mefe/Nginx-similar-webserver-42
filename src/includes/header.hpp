#define INTRO WHITE_BOLD"Webserver42 is an Nginx like Webserver that was made for educational purposes by 3 1337 students, it is \n\
all about recoding Nginx from scratch with socket programming. of course, this webserver is meant for production use\n\
but it is 90% behaves the same way Nginx serves requests under HTTP/1.1 protocol.\n\
\n\
The following options are available for program cli: \n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"-m [multiplexer]: "WHITE_BOLD"takes a multiplexer whether kqueue, epoll, poll or select and builds all the servers with it\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"--multiplexer [multiplexer]: "WHITE_BOLD"similar as above\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"--activate-strict_mode: "WHITE_BOLD"activates the strict mode, in this mode the program will not run unless there is no warnings\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"--activate-debugging_mode: "WHITE_BOLD"activates the debugging mode therefore the server administrator can debug requests and responses\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"--activate-caches: "WHITE_BOLD"activates the caching system to work, which mean any request that requires some processing will be served \n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"--register-logs: "WHITE_BOLD"register all the logs in a file, the file can be accessed in the current directory as webserver.logs\n\
 from the cache in case the same asset was already requested before\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"--register-caches: "WHITE_BOLD"register all the requests that require some processing in the cache therefore the future requests can be\n\
 served fastly from the cache\n\n"


#define README WHITE_BOLD"\
The following tokens are available for the http block: \n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"root [string]: "WHITE_BOLD"defines the root directory\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"allowed_methods [METHOD1, METHOD2 ...]: "WHITE_BOLD" or * asterisk for all the methods, identifies the \n\
 http methods allowed in the whole webserver\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"client_max_body_size [number]:"WHITE_BOLD" identifies the max body size per request\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"client_max_request_timeout [number]:"WHITE_BOLD" identifies the max request time the webserver waits \n\
 for the request\n\
  - "GREEN_BOLD"client_max_uri_size [number]:"WHITE_BOLD" identifies the max uri size in term of how many characters \n\
 the webserver can accept \n\
  - "GREEN_BOLD"cgi_max_request_timeout [number]: "WHITE_BOLD" specifies number of seconds to wait for the cgi process before it gets killed, \n\
the default value is 30 seconds\n\
  - "GREEN_BOLD"keep_alive_max_timeout [number]: "WHITE_BOLD" specifies the number of seconds to wait in a keep alive connection when the client has written nothing, \n\
the default value is 65 seconds\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"multiplexer [takes one of these 'kqueue' or 'epoll' or 'poll' or 'select']:"WHITE_BOLD" specifies the multiplexer used for simultaneous \n\
 connections, kqueue is the default one for FreeBSD and Apple distributions meanwhile Epoll is the default\n\
 one for Linux distributions\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"support_cookies [on/off]: "WHITE_BOLD" specifies if the webserver supports cookies or not\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"proxy_cache [on/off]: "WHITE_BOLD" specifies if the server should serve requests from the cache or not, the default is off\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"proxy_cache_register [on/off]: "WHITE_BOLD" specifies if the server should register the requests that require some processing for future use \
 the default is off\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"proxy_cache_max_time [time] ex. (10s, 10m, 10h, 10d): "WHITE_BOLD" specifies the period of time a request should get cached, 3 days is the default\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"proxy_cache_max_size [size] ex. (10by, 10kb, 10mb, 10gb): "WHITE_BOLD" specifies max size of the caches that the server should never surpass, \
 12mb is the default \n\n\
The following tokens are available for each server block: \n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"server_name [string]:"WHITE_BOLD" specifies the server name\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"listen [number]:"WHITE_BOLD" specifies the port the virtual server should listen on\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"try_index_files [index1, index2, ... indexN]:"WHITE_BOLD" takes index files that should be served as indexes\n\
 in case a directory has been requested rather than a normal file\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"try_404_files [file1, file2, ... fileN]:"WHITE_BOLD" takes 404 files that should be\n\
 served in case the requested path was not found\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"allowed_methods [*] for all the methods or [METHOD1, METHOD2, ... METHOD_N]:"WHITE_BOLD" takes multiple methods that \n\
 should be supported by the server\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"root [string]:"WHITE_BOLD" takes the root directory and starts serving files starting from it\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"client_max_connections [number]:"WHITE_BOLD" takes the number of the maximum simultaneous connections that a server can handle\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"error_page [error_number] [error_file]:"WHITE_BOLD" takes the number of the error and whenever the server has to respond \n\
 with that http code it servers the provided file as http body response\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"cgi_bin [.extension] [/bin_path]:"WHITE_BOLD" takes the extension and maps it with the bin cgi path that should be run in case a file \n\
 with the provided extension has been provided\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"max_client_request_timeout:"WHITE_BOLD" maximum time the server should wait for the client to write something as request, \n\
 the default is 2 seconds in case not provided\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"max_client_body_size:"WHITE_BOLD" maximum body size the server should consider from the client as http request\n\
  - "GREEN_BOLD"cgi_max_request_timeout [number]: "WHITE_BOLD" specifies number of seconds to wait for the cgi process before it gets killed, \n\
the default value is 30 seconds\n\
  - "GREEN_BOLD"keep_alive_max_timeout [number]: "WHITE_BOLD" specifies the number of seconds to wait in a keep alive connection and the client has written nothing, \n\
the default value is 65 seconds\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"location [location]:"WHITE_BOLD" defines a location block inside the server block more details about it below\n\
\n\
The following tokens are available for each location block: \n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"try_index_files [index1, index2, ... indexN]:"WHITE_BOLD" takes index files that should be served as indexes \n\
 in case this directory has been requested\n\
 - "GREEN_BOLD"try_404_files [file1, file2, ... fileN]:"WHITE_BOLD" takes 404 files that should be served in case the requested path was not found\n\
